## Angular User Management Features

This README provides an overview of the user management features implemented in an Angular application. The user management functionality handles various tasks related to user authentication, registration, and authorization within the application. Below are the key features and their descriptions:

### 1. User Registration
- Allows new users to create an account by providing their desired username, email, and password.
- Validates user inputs, such as password strength and email format.
- Performs necessary checks, such as username or email availability, to prevent duplicates.

### 2. User Login
- Enables users to authenticate themselves using their registered credentials (username/email and password).
- Performs authentication checks, such as verifying the provided credentials against stored user data.
- Generates and assigns an authentication token (e.g., JWT) to the user upon successful login.

### 3. User Logout
- Provides a mechanism for users to log out of their accounts, effectively invalidating their authentication token.
- Clears any stored authentication data and redirects the user to an appropriate landing page.

### 4. User Profile Management
- Allows users to view and edit their profile information, such as name, email, profile picture, or other relevant details.
- Validates and updates the user's profile data, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
- Provides functionality to upload and manage profile pictures or other media.

### 5. User Authentication Guards
- Implements route guards to protect certain application routes from unauthorized access.
- Checks for valid authentication tokens before granting access to protected routes.
- Redirects unauthenticated users to the login page or displays an appropriate error message.

### 6. User Role-Based Access Control
- Implements role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate between different user roles (e.g., admin, regular user).
- Restricts access to certain application features or resources based on the user's role.
- Controls visibility and functionality of UI elements based on the user's assigned role.

### 7. Password Reset
- Provides a mechanism for users to reset their forgotten passwords.
- Sends password reset instructions to the user's registered email.
- Validates the password reset request and allows users to set a new password.

### 8. User Data Storage
- Stores user-related information securely in a database or other persistent storage.
- Implements secure data access and retrieval mechanisms.
- Ensures data privacy and protection through appropriate security measures.

These features collectively provide a comprehensive user management system in an Angular application, enabling secure authentication, registration, and profile management for the application users.
